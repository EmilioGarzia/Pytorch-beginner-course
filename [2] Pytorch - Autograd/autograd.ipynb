    "Machine learning can be considered as an optimization problem, usually a minimization problem, for this reason the **derivates** are the main tools used by the training algorithms, thankfully pytorch offers a specifi module to solve the *derivates* and in particular the *gradients* of the functions, this module is `torch.autograd`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see, the concept of the derivates is very important to understand the mechanism of a learning algorithms, and with `autograd` we will not waste time to implements manually all functions that calculate the gradients, pytorch is one of the most used deep learning framework also for the `autograd`.\n",
